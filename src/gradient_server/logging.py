"""Configure logging for the Gradient Server.

A module containing a custom logging handler and helper function for
the Gradient server. These handle formatting logs, ensuring that logs
are logged both to a file and to the terminal (see note below!). Functionality
is also provided for retrieving logs for to send over HTTP.

Note that when running in production the Gradient server is run via
``systemd``. As such, the logs that are sent to the terminal (STDERR) or any other
output to STDOUT/STDERR are captured by ``systemd``. These can be viewed by using
``journalctl`` or the ``gradient journal`` command.
